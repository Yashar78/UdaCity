Exploratory Data Analysis

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd('/home/rahim/DelGitGub/UdaCity/EDA/Lesson3');
library(ggplot2)
pf <- read.csv('pseudo_facebook.tsv', sep='\t')
qplot(x = age, y = friend_count, data = pf);

ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), data = subset(pf, friend_count > 0  ))+ 
  #geom_point(alpha = 1/20 )+ 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/20 )+ 
  xlim(13,99)+
  coord_trans(y = "sqrt")

ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friendships_initiated), data = pf)+ 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/10, position = position_jitter(h = 0 ) )+ 
  xlim(13,99)+ 
  coord_trans(y = "sqrt") 


#consitional means 
library('dplyr')
age_groups <- group_by(pf,age)
pf.fc_by_age <- summarise(age_groups, 
                           friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count), 
                           frined_count_median = median(friend_count), 
                           n = n())

#same code as above but using pipe
age_groups <- group_by(pf,age)
pf.fc_by_age <-  pf %.%
                 group_by(age) %.%
                 summarise(friend_count_mean = mean(friend_count), 
                           frined_count_median = median(friend_count), 
                           n = n()) %.%
                arrange(age)


head(pf.fc_by_age)
#pf.fc_by_age <- arrange(pf.fc_by_age, age)


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
